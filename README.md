# Hello-World
My First Repository

Greetings Visitor

Agarton here, I am reletively new to the world of developing and programming however do not get any funny ideas, I am hard working, dedicated, and strive to learn as much as possible as quickly as I can so I may be able to reach my dream of becoming a dev.

A little about me, I graduated this May from the University of Puget Sound with a BA in international Economics and a double minor in P&G and Economics. I just recently moved to Temecula CA and am loving the drastic change of pace between here and my long time home of Washington. Up until about a day ago programming and computer related activities were just a nerdy passtime of mine that I enjoyed doing in my very limited free time, however, yesterday I came to the realization that I do not any longer want to pursue my law degree like I initially planned and really want to pursue my love for code further and into a career. As i said I did not study this in school so my experience is very random and still quite limited. I am hoping to come across some wonderful people willing to take a chance on a kid who wont dissappoint them and will exceed all expectations with just a few pointers along the way.
